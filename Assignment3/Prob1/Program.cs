Module 4, Programming Assignment 3, Problem 1

    Class Diagramming Tool

- Create a class hierarchy using ONLY the class diagram tool.
- The hierarchy should be at least 3 deep.
- The hierarchy should be at least 2 wide at the second level (level
    inheriting from the base).
- The base class should be an abstract class.
- Create your own naming scheme. Names should indicate position of class in
    the hierarchy.
- Write-up should:
    - Explain your naming scheme
    - Describe what tool views/fields you had to use to create your class
        hierarchy. In other words, explain the use of the class diagramming
        tool to someone who hasn't ever used it before.
    - Describe the use of the "abstract" keyword. What constraints does it put
        on the class that it modifies? What affect does it have on class
        members (like fields and methods)?
    - Describe the code generated. How does this help you code?
